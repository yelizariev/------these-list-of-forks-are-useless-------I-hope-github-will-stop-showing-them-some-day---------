"Spent about a week trying to coerce \"standard\" javascript tools (jsdoc_"
" with the hope of using sphinx-js_ for integration or "
"`documentation.js`_) and failed to ever get a sensible result: failed to "
"get any result with the current state of the documentation, significant "
"changes/additions/fixes to docstrings brought this up to \"garbage "
"output\" level."

"Bug reports and mailing list posts didn't show any path to improvement on"
" the ES5 codebase (if we ever go whole-hog on ES6 modules and classes "
"things could be different, in fact most of JSDoc's current effort seem "
"focused on ES6/ES2015 features) but both experience and looking at the "
"mailing lists told me that spending more time would be wasted."

"If it were possible to generate JSDoc annotations from our relatively "

"a command-line interface which can be invoked via ``-m autojsdoc`` "
"(assuming your ``PYTHONPATH`` can find it) which should allow dumping the"

"pyjsparser_, an Esprima-compliant ES5.1 parser (with bits of ES6 "
"support), sadly it does not support comments in its current form so I had"
" to fork it. Fed a javascript source file, pyjsparser_ simply generates a"
" bunch of nested dicts representing an Esprima ast, ast-types_ does a "
"reasonably good job of describing it once you understand that \"bases\" "
"are basically just structural mixins."
